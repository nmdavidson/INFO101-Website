# INFO101 Website Project
This is the repo for hosting our static HTML website for a group project in INFO101 at UMass Amherst. 4/10/22

Navigating the website should be pretty familiar to users of the Internet. A navigation bar is located at the top of each page. Styles differ from page to page so this structure might be slightly different. Hyperlinks are embedded in text or objects styled with CSS. Standard cursor functionality applies on most pages. Natty's page has interactive buttons that can be clicked to change style sheets. 

Any questions or comments can be directed to nmdavidson@umass.edu or one of the other group members:
