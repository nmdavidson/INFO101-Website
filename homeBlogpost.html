            <h2>PIDs: What are they and how do they work?</h2>
            <h3>Or how to cook ribs perfectly for your beach cookout</h3>
            <p>
                I first encountered proportional-integral-derivative, or PID, control in a 
                setting that until recently was unpopulated by this technology: consumer 
                electronics. Even more uncommon was that the consumer electronic that 
                introduced me to this technology was an instrument used for cooking, an 
                area which on the surface is devoid of innovation and has relied on age-old 
                technology since its humble beginnings.
            <p>
                One summer afternoon, waking up from a night of high-school-aged debauchery 
                at my friend's house, I meandered into his kitchen to find his father bent over 
                a YETI cooler with a cord running from it, plugged into the wall and steam 
                emanating from within. Of course I was intrigued. I ventured over to inquire 
                about what in fact I was witnessing. 
            <p>
                Peering into the cooler, I saw hunks of vacuum-sealed ribs bobbing in 
                turbulent water and off to the side a slim cylinder clipped to the side of 
                the cooler with a cord running to an outlet. I asked him what exactly I was 
                looking at.
            <p>
                "Sous vide," he said, like I was supposed to know what that meant.
            <p>
                "What's that?," I replied.
            <p>
                He told me about this modern cooking technique, naturally modeled after a 
                traditional French cooking style, of using warm water to raise the internal 
                temperature of whatever is submerged. He was raising the temperature of the 
                ribs in order to bring them to the beach and quickly char the outsides on the 
                grill without having to worry about the meat being cooked through or standing 
                by the grill for half-an-hour while they cooked as one would do normally. I 
                found this quite clever, but still wondered why this contraption was necessary. 
            <p>
                He explained to me the nature of the temperature of water when it is heated on 
                a stove, how it fluctuates depending on many factors&mdash;especially if using a 
                resistive-heat electric stovetop&mdash;and how something called a PID controller, 
                which was found inside his mysterious sous vide cylinder, was able to maintain 
                a stable water temperature so that you could target the internal temperature of 
                whatever you submerged to a decimal degree. I was fascinated.<hr>
            <p>
                Souse vide can be translated from French to mean "under vacuum." While the device
                I described witnessing in my friend's kitchen is often referred to as souse vide or
                a sous vide cooker, more accurate is to call it an immersion circulator and the technique
                itself as souse vide. Though today the technique has found its way into some of the most 
                prestigious restaurants in the world, the technology was originally developed with a much 
                more humble aim. 
            <p>
                The technology and technique were introduced in scientific laboratories 
                to maintain precise temperature control of immersion baths in lab conditions (thanks to the 
                PID control, we're getting to that.) This naturally transitioned to using sous vide for
                purposes like sterilization and pasteurization in settings like hospitals and large-scale
                commerial food producers. They could vacuum seal instruments or food products, immerse them 
                for a certain amount of time, and then remove them with the certainty that they reached the
                specified temperature. Time was being saved and processes were being made safer, a win-win.
            <p>
                Chefs began to realize how this technique could allow them more precise control&mdash;in fact, 
                drastically so&mdash; of the internal temperature of the food they were cooking, most
                importantly the expensive cuts of protein that were notoriosully stubborn in revealing
                the chemistry unfolding within them. It can't be overstated: this changed the game. Souse
                vide cooking has since trickled down to the consumer level and has found its way into 
                kitchens like that of my friend's father. Often overlooked, however, is the true technological
                innovation that made this all possible. Let's take a few steps backwards.

                Feedback control is one of those things that operates under the surface, holds so much
                "control" over the functioning of our modern society, yet rarely gets the props it deserves,
                much less the appreciation of its beneficiaries, most of whom would be incapable of telling
                you what in fact it is or what it does. So I guess that begs the question... what is it and
                what the hell does it do? I'm glad you asked.
            <p>
                The theory of feedback control, i.e. control theory, was developed at, where else, Bell Labs
                in the 1930s. Like most consumer facing technological innovation, control systems have their
                roots in military applications. In WWII, control systems were developed for applications such
                as inteligent rocket control and unmanned aircraft surveillance. Today, control systems govern
                nearly any "system" you can think of, especially those with some sort of autonomy. An immense 
                amount of brain-power is currently being used to devise inteligent algorithms for control systems.
                Do autonomous vehicles, self-landing rockets, humanoid robots ring any bells? (Hey Elon) Control
                systems do just what the sound like: they control systems. Feedback control systems tweak this by
                introducing outputs of the system as inputs back into the system. By correctly interpreting this
                input, or system "feedback," systems can stabilize.
            <p>
                This is done by comparing the feedback of the system to a reference and generating an error as a
                result. Depending on the nature of the error and the system itself, the system may be able respond
                to this feedback by changing its output in a hope to lessen the error present in the system. A
                natural question is why is any of this necessary? As it turns out, many systems are inherently
                unstable or we are unable to construct them without introducing a certain degree of uncertainty.
                Feedback systems allow systems to adapt to these problems without destroying the system or having
                to intermittently stop the system.
            <p>
                There are a few fundamental elements necessary to be familiar with in order to undestand
                the behavior of a feedback control system. They are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the plant: the actual system being controlled. Each plant has different characteristics
                        and behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        actuators: these are elements of the control system that "allow the manipulation of
                        control variables in a process."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sensors: most people are familiar with sensors in that they "sense" what happens around them.
                        Sensors come in any and every form to fit any imaginable applications. They can be used to measure
                        temperature, pressure, velocity, light intensity, etc. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        controllers: the brains of the control system. They determine how the system should respond to
                        inputs, more specifically, they tell the actuators how to respond to measurements from the sensors.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                One of the simplest and often misunderstood feedback systems present in your daily life
                is the contraption that lives in the back of your toilet. While this is a mechanical feedback
                system, it is a feedback system nonetheless. The actuator in this system is the valve that allows
                water to enter the tank of the toilet. The sensor is the float, or that plastic bulb, that determines at what
                level the water in the tank is currently. The controller is the mechanism with which the float
                can close the valve when it reaches the correct height, or water level. You might think "BFD" but
                this system is actually quite robust. It adapts to low water flow or a faulty drain and ensures
                a constant flush by maintaining the same water level each time. Its something we rarely, if ever,
                think about. That is, until it fails.
            <p>
                Now this control is specified to this application and naturally wouldn't translate to many other
                applications. Therefore it is often necessary to specify a controller to its application. However,
                there are broad classes of controllers that have applications in a broader range of applications.
                One such of these classes, in fact the most commonly used in industry, is PID controllers, commonly 
                referred to simply as PIDs. The proportional-integral-derivative controller consists of three main 
                components that you may have guessed by its name are the proportional controller, the integral controller, 
                and the derivative controller. Note in this sense, that PIDs are controllers constructed from other 
                controllers. Let's break these down individually to understand what a PID is doing as a whole. 
            <p>

                <h4>Proportional Control</h4><br>
                This may seem rather self explanatory, but it is important to understand how this controller captures
                scenarios that render PIDs as effective as they are. Proportional controllers tend to react quickly, but
                overshoot and thus reduce, but don't minimize, steady-state error. They do this by proportionally scaling 
                the output response relative to the error. This can be seen in the the first term of the equation below.
                <h4>Integral Control</h4><br>
